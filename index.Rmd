I am a Plant Pathologist at the University of Queensland.
I specialise in modelling crop diseases and building decision support tools.

## Recent work  

### Simulation model for ascochyta blight  
#### May 2022  

`ascotraceR` is an R package which simulates ascochyta blight epidemics in chickpea
crops.
You can find `ascotraceR` on CRAN, and a resource announcement in *Phytopathology*.

### Is UniSuper's Defined Benifit Division fund worthwhile Shiny App  
#### May 2022  

Choice of superannuation is not the first type of research people like to do when starting a new job.
Most people want to finish the induction paperwork and financial forms as quickly as possible so they can commence diligently working for their new employer.
Therefore I gather most people would not fully dedicate their time to trying to understand 'What is a defined benefit division?' and 'Is it the best super product for me?'.
I certainly did not when I started work with the University of Southern Queensland almost four years ago.
I was coerced into UniSupers DBD and only 3 years down the track I realise it was not for me.  

When checking up on my super balance, shortly after starting work at The University of Queensland, 
I noticed that the total contributions I made from my salary after tax exceeded the fund balance.
Suffice to say, I liken the DBD to a pyramid scheme which only benefits people who are over the age of 50. 
In fact it is almost impossible to have a positive net return if you exit the fund before the age of 46.  

To help people understand how the DBD is calculated I created a shiny app which can be found at the following link

### 2022 Election shiny app  
#### May 2022  

I have been working on a shiny app to help a political party I am a member of, 
the [Fusion Party, *Science, Pirate, Secular and Climate Emergency Parties*](https://www.fusionparty.org.au/)  
The shiny app was made to easily convert electoral boundaries data from shape file
to `KML` file so they could be uploaded on a shared Google maps. 
Needless to say the app expanded monstrously when I found more data on the [AEC website](https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/HouseDownloadsMenu-24310-Csv.htm).  

I included some analysis of voting preferences by division and voting booth, including
expected voter turnout to booths.

### Estimating leaf temperature from NASA satalite data  
#### April 2022  

I wrote a blog, published on OpenPlantPathology's website, for how to use R to 
estimate leaf temperatures from data retrieved using the `nasapower` R package. 
Then plugging the data into functions from the R package `tealeaves`.
The result is being able to estimate the leaf temperature for any where on the planet.

### Efficient control of powdery mildew in mungbeans  
#### November 2021  

This paper uses meta-analytic methods to examine 16 field trials over eight seasons assessing fungicide spray timing for control of powdery mildew.  

[Read the paper in *Plant Disease*](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PDIS-06-21-1256-RE).
