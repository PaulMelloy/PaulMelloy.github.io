Welcome to my website.  

I am a Plant Pathologist at the University of Queensland.
I specialise in modelling crop diseases and building decision support tools.

## Recent work  

### Simulation model for ascochyta blight  

`ascotraceR` is an R package which simulates ascochyta blight epidemics in chickpea
crops.
You can find `ascotraceR` on CRAN, and a resource announcement in phytopathology.

[ascotraceR: An R Package Resource to Simulate the Spatiotemporal Spread of Ascochyta Blight in a Chickpea Field Over a Growing Season](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PHYTO-01-22-0016-A)

### 2022 Election shiny app  

I have been working on a shiny app to help a political party I am a member of, 
the [Fusion Party, *Science, Pirate, Secular and Climate Emergency Parties*](https://www.fusionparty.org.au/)  
The shiny app was made to easily convert electoral boundaries data from shape file
to `KML` file so they could be uploaded on a shared Google maps. 
Needless to say the app expanded monstrously when I found more data on the [AEC website](https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/HouseDownloadsMenu-24310-Csv.htm).  

I included some analysis of voting preferences by division and voting booth, including
expected voter turnout to booths.

### Estimating leaf temperature from NASA satalite data  

I wrote a blog, published on OpenPlantPathology's website, for how to use R to 
estimate leaf temperatures from data retrieved using the `nasapower` R package. 
Then plugging the data into functions from the R package `tealeaves`.
The result is being able to estimate the leaf temperature for any where on the planet.
