I am a Plant Pathologist at the University of Queensland.
I specialise in modelling crop diseases and building decision support tools.

## Recent work  

### National Pulse Pathology Meeting & Ascochyta blight Workshop  
#### October 2022  
An amazing week of presentations and discussions around pulse pathology and ascochyta
blight research in chickpea. 
I had a great time learning about chickpea breading efforts and disease epidemiology
research.
I came away with some excellent insights that I wish to apply as improvements to 
the `ascotraceR` model. Watch this space.

### GRDC Update - Miles - Pitsworth - Goondiwindi  
#### July 2022  
At the end of July, I travelled around South East Queensland to the GRDC Updates
to present the decision support tools which have been developed on the GRDC funded
project I am involved with. A second la nina at the start of 2022 has provided a 
lot of moisture which are likely to lead to heavy losses to foliar diseases if crops
are not managed well for disease.  

The main apps we were presenting for the Northern grains region were
[StripeRustWM](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/apps/striperustwm) 
and [YellowSpotWM](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/apps/yellowspotwm-yellow-leaf-spot-management).  

There was a lot of interest in the applications and many were not yet familiar with
the available suit of decision support tools (DST). With a full moisture profile across 
many of the cropping areas those who were able to sow had more options. With seemingly 
more growers from the Goondiwindi region going into canola. Some farm managers were
therefore interested in the canola DSTs [SclerotiniaCM](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/apps/sclerotiniacm-sclerotinia-management-app),
and [UCI BlackLegCM](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/apps/uci-blacklegcm-blackleg-upper-canopy-infection-management-app).

### Farms Advice - Plant disease modelling interview
#### June 2022
I had a great chat with ABC rural trailblazer [Jack Cresswell](https://twitter.com/jcressw3) on his [Farms Advice](https://farmsadvice.com.au/) podcast.

### Simulation model for ascochyta blight  
#### May 2022  

`ascotraceR` is an R package which simulates ascochyta blight epidemics in chickpea
crops.
You can find `ascotraceR` on CRAN, and a resource announcement in *Phytopathology*.

### Is UniSuper's Defined Benefit Division fund worthwhile Shiny App  
#### May 2022  

Choice of superannuation is not the first type of research people like to do when starting a new job.
Most people want to finish the induction paperwork and financial forms as quickly as possible so they can commence diligently working for their new employer.
Therefore I gather most people would not fully dedicate their time to trying to understand 'What is a defined benefit division?' and 'Is it the best super product for me?'.
I certainly did not when I started work with the University of Southern Queensland almost four years ago.
I was coerced into UniSupers DBD and only 3 years down the track I realise it was not for me.  

When checking up on my super balance, shortly after starting work at The University of Queensland, 
I noticed that the total contributions I made from my salary after tax exceeded the fund balance.
Suffice to say, I liken the DBD to a pyramid scheme which only benefits people who are over the age of 50. 
In fact it is almost impossible to have a positive net return if you exit the fund before the age of 46.  

To help people understand how the DBD is calculated I created a shiny app which can be found at the following link

### 2022 Election shiny app  
#### May 2022  

I have been working on a shiny app to help a political party I am a member of, 
the [Fusion Party, *Science, Pirate, Secular and Climate Emergency Parties*](https://www.fusionparty.org.au/)  
The shiny app was made to easily convert electoral boundaries data from shape file
to `KML` file so they could be uploaded on a shared Google maps. 
Needless to say the app expanded monstrously when I found more data on the [AEC website](https://results.aec.gov.au/24310/Website/HouseDownloadsMenu-24310-Csv.htm).  

I included some analysis of voting preferences by division and voting booth, including
expected voter turnout to booths.

### Estimating leaf temperature from NASA satellite data  
#### April 2022  

I wrote a blog, published on OpenPlantPathology's website, for how to use R to 
estimate leaf temperatures from data retrieved using the `nasapower` R package. 
Then plugging the data into functions from the R package `tealeaves`.
The result is being able to estimate the leaf temperature for any where on the planet.

### Efficient control of powdery mildew in mungbeans  
#### November 2021  

This paper uses meta-analytic methods to examine 16 field trials over eight seasons assessing fungicide spray timing for control of powdery mildew.  

[Read the paper in *Plant Disease*](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PDIS-06-21-1256-RE).
