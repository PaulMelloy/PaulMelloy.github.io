and <a href="https://people.csiro.au/P/H/Hazel-Parry.aspx">Dr Hazel

Correspondance, <em>“Large language models can help to translate science
into real-world impact”</em></a>.</p>
<p>Many academics are hesitant to embrace the Large Language Model
revolution, however the genie can no longer be put back in the lamp and
it is integrating itself in our day-to-day life. What this technology
does well translate complex ideas and language to a somewhat succinct
summaries that are more readable. This is what we as scientists are
rather terrible at, communicating complex ideas to the wider public, and
we could gain a lot by using LLMs to enable this. The latest models have
come a long way and even though it is probably for the LLM to include
mistakes, we as scientists should be involved in the testing to ensure
improved accuracy.</p>

<h3>AusMac Macadamia Conference</h3>
<div id="october-2024" class="section level4">
<h4>30 - 31 October 2024</h4>
<p>The Pest READI project I’m working on focuses on horticultural
industries in the Northern Rivers area of Northern New South Wales. This
region has been severely impacted by recent disruptions, including <a
href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-31/floods-lismore-byron-bay-northern-rivers-why-come-in-clusters/100954926">the
2022 floods</a> and the <a
href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/backstory/2023-09-26/abc-emergency-black-summer-upcoming-bushfire-season/102871620">black
summer bushfires in 2020</a>. The Pest READI team is conducting research
on how this resilient community implements integrated pest management
practices and collaborates with them to design tools that enhance
preparedness and resilience for future changes.</p>
<p>The Northern Rivers region is home to significant horticultural
industries, including macadamias, which are one of the largest in the
area. Alongside avocados, these crops contribute significantly to the
local economy. The conference, which brings together industry
professionals, growers, and agronomists, featured a wide range of
topics.</p>
<p>This year’s event highlighted several key areas of focus.
<strong>Machinery and automation</strong> were well-represented, with
many attendees seeking solutions to reduce labor costs in the face of
high demand for workers. However, the investment required to adopt new
machinery was a significant consideration for farm businesses.</p>
<p>The conference also explored the importance of macadamia markets,
which have faced challenges from competitors in South Africa and China.
<strong>Spatial models</strong>, presented by <a
href="https://www.une.edu.au/staff-profiles/science-and-technology/andy-clark">Andy
Clark from UNE</a>, demonstrated how earth observation can be used to
identify and map tree crops. These models also highlighted the potential
for improved weather warning systems and monitoring of seasonal
phenology.</p>
<p>The <strong>Trade displays</strong> offered a wealth of information
on novel AgTech products targeting agricultural and horticultural
production. Farm management platforms, such as <a
href="https://www.informag.com.au/">InformAg</a> and <a
href="https://fieldin.com/">FieldIn</a>, were showcased as tools to
organize farm tasks and improve record-keeping for compliance.</p>
<p>The importance of pollination was emphasized in several talks and at
related stalls. <a href="https://www.beehero.io/">Bee Hero</a> presented
acoustic monitoring technology to understand bee activity, while <a
href="https://www.wheenbeefoundation.org.au/">Wheen Bee</a> offered
grants for planting insect-friendly habitats. <a
href="https://www.biologicalservices.com.au/">Biological Services</a>
supplied beneficial insects to suppress pests.</p>

<h3>GRDC Soil-borne disease workshop</h3>
<div id="august-2024" class="section level4">
<h4>August 2024</h4>
<p>Early this month I visited Sydney to talk at the GRDC soil-borne
diseases workshop. There were some interesting discussions about the
complexity to manage soil and stubble borne diseases in grain crops. A
primary concern was, despite heroic efforts by our Aussie plant
pathologists, that past research was not easily able to translate to
measurable impact.<br />
Additionally growers are not aware of the increasing chronic disease
impact as a result of increased stubble retention and zero till farming
in Australia.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly there seems to be strong support for digital tools to
help translate research to impact and simplify disease management
options with decision support tools. However, will the rest of the GRDC
research managers and regional panels agree???</p>
<p>Thank you to <a href="https://www.colere.com.au/">Colare</a> group

net-blotch in barley – a meta-analysis” at the GRDC updates in
Goondiwindi and Dubbo. This described the results of a meta-analysis of
fungicide trials across Australia to determine the best fungicide timing
to maximise yield protection.</p>

<h3><code>Extract</code> from nested lists in R</h3>
<div id="november-2023" class="section level4">
<h4>November 2023</h4>
<p><code>Extract</code>ing from lists and nested lists using the “[[”
function is always a bit of syntax I forget and can never seem to google
the answer to easily. So I post it here for myself to easily reference
in the future. <em>Edit - more information can be obtained from</em>
<code>?Extract</code>.</p>
<p>Wearing my programming and data-science hats, lists can be a
extremely useful way to store and organise data. This is especially true
for epidemiological model outputs. Yet newcomers will find lists can be
difficult to understand and find it even more difficult to easily
retrieve data from especially for nested lists. This is a short-hand way
to easily retrieve the same element within a nested list.</p>
<p>First lets create a nested list.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># set random seed for reproducibility
set.seed(28)
nested_list &lt;- lapply(1:3, function(x) {
  return(list(
    capitals = sample(LETTERS),
    smallcaps = sample(letters),
    numbers = sample(1:50)
  ))
})

#head(nested_list)</code></pre>
<p>Here we have created a list with a length of 3 with three lists
nested inside each list with names “capitals”, “smallcaps” and
“numbers”.</p>
<p>Frequently we only want to pull all of one nested list. To do this we
use two opening square brackets <code>"[["</code> as the function,
followed by the name of the list.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lapply(nested_list,&quot;[[&quot;, &quot;capitals&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
##  [1] &quot;Q&quot; &quot;Z&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;Y&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;K&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;W&quot; &quot;L&quot; &quot;X&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;J&quot;
## [20] &quot;F&quot;
##  [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 6 entries ]
## 
## [[2]]
##  [1] &quot;E&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;Z&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;J&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;V&quot; &quot;W&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;O&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;U&quot; &quot;Y&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;Q&quot; &quot;K&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;D&quot;
## [20] &quot;T&quot;
##  [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 6 entries ]
## 
## [[3]]
##  [1] &quot;M&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;K&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;Y&quot; &quot;W&quot; &quot;Z&quot; &quot;R&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;V&quot; &quot;P&quot; &quot;X&quot; &quot;U&quot; &quot;O&quot;
## [20] &quot;J&quot;
##  [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 6 entries ]</code></pre>
<p>This also works by indicating the integer of the nested list i.e
<code>lapply(list1,"[[", 2)</code>. <br><br />

<h4>November 2023</h4>
<p>Through October and November I had the opportunity to develop my
industry engagement skills. The OnPrime program run by CSIRO provides
researchers with coaching on how to improve their engagement with
industry and ensure improved outcomes for researchers and industry
investors. This program taught me how to develop a research project that
is tailored to the needs of industry to ensure research gains are
focused on what is novel and needed.</p>
<p>Our team researched the opportunity for developing a turf breeding
program to support the turf industry.</p>
<p>I was surprised on the importance of turf in our culture, society and
economy. We learned it can cost approximately $700k to import new
varieties to Australia from the US. These varieties may not even be
suitable for Australia’s varied and harsh climate.<br />
Sporting turf surfaces are at capacity, and with the rise in women’s
sport, demand is still growing placing a lot of pressure on sporting
surfaces. We could save sporting clubs money by developing a wear
tolerant grass which reduces the chance of cancelled games. In addition
a more tolerant turf for stadiums might increase the opportunity for
more frequent games, concerts and events. Boosting revenue for the
stadiums, local businesses and tourism.</p>

air-conditioning could barely cope with the temperatures outside and
despite the amazing talks, my attention could not help to wander to the

<p>The attendees of the Episense satellite meeting were genuinely good
company and not only provided stimulating phytopathological discussions,
but also extended a collaborative effort into robust research of the
Lyonnaise cultural pursuits.<br />

<h4>November 2022</h4>
<p>I am pleased to share a pre-print of a paper I have been assisting
with, titled, “The influence of temperature and vapour pressure deficit
on conidial germination and germ tubes production in an Australian
<em>Podosphaera xanthii</em> isolate.” The paper has been submitted for
review at the <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10658">European
Journal of Plant Pathology</a>. The work was undertaken as part of
Zaiton Sapak’s PhD and furthers our understanding on the temperature and
vapour pressure conditions which influence germination rate and
infection success of <em>P. xanthii</em> on cucurbit leaves.</p>
<p>Powdery mildew is at a high risk of evolving fungicide resistance and
improper applications can be costly, hastening the evolution of
fungicide resistance. Understanding the conditions at which the crop is
at risk of infection will lead to the development of models and
decisions support tools which increase the lead time to prepare for
fungicide applications and timing sprays for maximum efficacy, reducing
excessive spray applications or the immediate cost of applying
ineffective poorly timed sprays.</p>
<p>The results from this paper show the optimum conditions for rapid
conidia germination and the production of secondary and tertiary
germ-tubes (a proxy for successful infection) was 28°C at saturated
vapour pressure. Germination was prevented at temperatures above 34°C
and below 8°C and reduced at other temperatures. As vapour pressure
deficit increased germination and germ tube production decreased in a
non-linear relationship and never completely prevented conidial
germination or germ-tube production.</p>
<p>I assisted with statistical analysis and final drafts of the paper.

<h4>July 2022</h4>
<p>At the end of July, I travelled around South East Queensland to the
GRDC Updates to present the decision support tools which have been
developed on the GRDC funded project I am involved with. A second la
nina at the start of 2022 has provided a lot of moisture which are
likely to lead to heavy losses to foliar diseases if crops are not
managed well for disease.</p>
<p>The main apps we were presenting for the Northern grains region were
<a href="https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/apps/striperustwm">StripeRustWM</a>
and <a
href="https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/apps/yellowspotwm-yellow-leaf-spot-management">YellowSpotWM</a>.</p>
<p>There was a lot of interest in the applications and many were not yet
familiar with the available suit of decision support tools (DST). With a
full moisture profile across many of the cropping areas those who were
able to sow had more options. With seemingly more growers from the
Goondiwindi region going into canola. Some farm managers were therefore
interested in the canola DSTs <a

<h3>Is UniSuper’s Defined Benefit Division fund worthwhile Shiny
App</h3>
<div id="may-2022-1" class="section level4">
<h4>May 2022</h4>
<p>Choice of superannuation is not the first type of research people
like to do when starting a new job. Most people want to finish the
induction paperwork and financial forms as quickly as possible so they
can commence diligently working for their new employer. Therefore I
gather most people would not fully dedicate their time to trying to
understand ‘What is a defined benefit division?’ and ‘Is it the best
super product for me?’. I certainly did not when I started work with the
University of Southern Queensland almost four years ago. I was coerced
into UniSuper’s DBD and only 3 years down the track I realise it was not
for me.</p>
<p>When checking up on my super balance, shortly after starting work at
The University of Queensland, I noticed that the total contributions I
made from my salary after tax exceeded the fund balance. Suffice to say,
I liken the DBD to a pyramid scheme which only benefits people who are
over the age of 50. In fact it is almost impossible to have a positive
net return if you exit the fund before the age of 46.</p>
<p>To help people understand how the DBD is calculated I created a shiny
app which can be found at the following link <a
