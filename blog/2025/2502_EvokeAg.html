<h2>Day 0 - 2025-02-10</h2>
<div id="sideline-event---qld-agtech-summit" class="section level3">
<h3>Sideline Event - QLD AgTech Summit</h3>
<p>Kicking off the week was the <a
href="https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/news-media/campaigns/agtech/action/qld-agtech-summit">Queensland
Governments <em>AgTech Summit</em>.</a> While networking was a key
highlight for everyone attending, one of the keynotes by Jerome Leroy of
<a href="https://www.infarm.io/">InFarm</a>, conveyed some insights for
aspiring start-ups and researchers alike. Not only should AgTech
interventions be driven by solving a problem growers have they need to
provide <strong>Value</strong>.</p>
<center>
<span class="math inline">\(Value = \frac{Outcome \times
Trust^{*}}{Effort \times Time \times Cost} \times Perceived
Risk\)</span><br />
*trust = Probability it works x Intent
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>To unpack this equation further; with out building trust in the
delivery of an ‘outcome’ or (Agtech product) and the <em>intent</em> to
follow-up on issues or servicing the ‘outcome’ with support it has a
<strong><em>low value</em></strong> to growers. Additionally effort,
time and cost to adopt, the lower the value of the technology to
growers. There are many ways you can cut this equation, however it comes
down to fact growers are wise to the parade of snake oil merchants and
need to see there is <em>value</em> in the <em>time</em>,
<em>effort</em> and <em>cost</em> to adopt new tech. Additionally given
the weather dependant nature of farming, growers will only have the
probability of a big pay check three to six times in a standard 30 year
career. Reinforcing the need to see the value in the technology before
adopting it.</p>

<p>Another stand out example of poor relationship between researchers
and growers was provided by Natalie Engel (If I recall correctly). After
they were contacted by a researcher about hosting some research they
sort legal advice at the cost of $400. However the researcher never
returned their call and they were left out of pocket despite being
interested in hosting the researchers.</p>
<p>A surprising hit session (<em>for me</em>) for the day was the
concurrent session <em>“Protecting and funding innovation: R&amp;D tax
incentives and IP eligibility”</em> presented by <a
href="https://mk.com.au/people/mark-metzeling/">Mark Metzeling</a>. As a
researcher who regularly seeks collaboration with growers for on farm
trials, or SME to fund research, I wanted to know what tax incentives
are available these potential partners. Mark explained that for
businesses with less than $20 million dollars in turnover, 43% of all
costs associated with research and development can be claimed as an
offset.</p>
<p>Requirement to claim R&amp;D offsets, however include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Registering the business with <a
href="https://www.industry.gov.au/science-technology-and-innovation/industry-innovation/ausindustry">AusIndustry</a>.<br />
</li>
<li>Registering the intent to undertake R&amp;D for the financial year,
within 10 months of the end of the financial year.<br />
</li>
<li>Maintain records showing research hypothesis, methods, and notes on
supervision of the trial and a summary of the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mark also strongly recommended using a accountant that solely
specialises in R&amp;D tax offset accounting when claiming these
costs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I was struck by the nice visual representation of benchmarking with
radar charts by the <a href="https://www.tnqdroughthub.com.au/">Tropical
North Queensland (TNQ) Drought hub</a> team.</p>

<h3>EvokeAg</h3>
<p>I arrived early to the conference so I could visit many of the trade
displays before the plenary. I talked to the crew at <a
href="https://www.beestar.com.au/">BeeStar</a>, who have a hive
management system and sensors to monitor hive health. We briefly
discussed their involvement in the “Bee2Tree” program, were growers
share pesticide application intentions with bee keepers with hives in
the area. This trial program intrigued me as it deals with the tricky
issue of sharing sensitive data with unknown third parties.<br />
I inspected <a href="https://getfarmlab.com/">FarmLab’s</a> platform,
which provides a chain of custody around soil samples and analysis.
Impressively the platform is built on military grade software to ensure
samples are collected in a standardised manner and the data is
secure.</p>

<p>Following the opening ceremony was an interactive plenary where the
audience was invited to nominate talking points on the greatest
challenges for the Australian Agriculture and Horticultural industry. A
feisty discussion with at times reflected on the poor relationship
between growers and researchers. I copied all 124 <a
href="https://www.slido.com/">slido</a> responses from the audience and
asked a LLM to summarise the top talking points.</p>
<p>Some key points that emerged from the conversation (according to the
LLM) include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Lack of national workforce strategy:</strong> There seems
to be a consensus that Australia does not have a comprehensive national
workforce strategy for the agricultural industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2. Need for food security policy:</strong> Several
participants suggested that a food security policy is needed to sit
under a workforce development strategy, as there currently is no clear
framework in place.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>3. Importance of identifying and removing barriers:</strong>
One participant suggested that a national workforce strategy should
focus on identifying and removing barriers to entry, rather than trying
to create artificial barriers to competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4. Need for innovation and technology adoption:</strong> Some
responses voiced<br />
frustration that research in agriculture is sometimes disconnected to
the development of new technologies to improve productivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>5. Concerns about venture funding:</strong> Responses
expressed concerns that reliance on venture capital funding may not be
sufficient to support the growth of the agricultural industry,
particularly in terms of investment in itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6. Water security:</strong> Several participants discussed
the need for Australia to secure and guarantee its water supply in order
to remain competitive globally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>7. Competitiveness:</strong> The conversation touched on the
need for Australia to address issues such as input costs (e.g., inputs
like fertilizer, and water) which are eating into profit margins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My takeaway from most of this discussion was that most attendees were
not aware of the difference between research for innovation or
discovery. And that shortfalls in government funding for universities
these days have resulted in a sector that is predominantly focused on
servicing the education sector rather research for industry.</p>

<p>I caught a bit of Malachi Clements talk about improving indigenous
nutrition through permaculture and community gardens. Such a great
initiative, amazing to see collective grass-roots action having such
great impact in rural communities.</p>

<h3>Natural Capital</h3>
<p>Following lunch I ducked into “Is natural capital the answer?”
breakout room to place additional context around the role of natural
capital for supporting beneficial insect populations and suppressing
pests in broadacre cropping. The session posed the question,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What value can natural capital bring to the agricultural sector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then asked us to work in groups to brainstorm a pitch to highlight
the value of increasing natural capital on farms. Surprisingly I found
the wider discussion disconnected to, what I view are, the perspectives
of regional producers. Focusing on the value of natural capital in terms
of carbon sequestration and doing right by future generations. While
these are noble goals to champion, which producers would love to aspire
to, at the end of the day growers are running a business and prioritise
the keeping their business profitable. I think it could have had greater
impact if it focused on the value of natural capital to their business
in terms of resilience to erosion, drought, pests and diseases.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Our table pitched ideas around these ideas, to improve the public
perspective of what natural capital can contribute to the agricultural
sector, beyond the talking points of city think-tanks. Shout out to <a

Grainger</a> who provided some great ideas to our pitch.</p>
<p>Disappointingly I had to miss the role playing in the “What do you
do? Real decisions, in a hypothetical crisis”. This was a session where
panellists with varied roles in Ag, business and trade played out a
hypothetical crisis around a data breach of a major hypothetical AgTech
company “FarmCorp”.</p>
<p>The evening officially concluded with the “Festival of Food”, samples
of dishes using local ingredients. By this time in the evening my mental
capacity for coherent conversation was waning and I found myself at a
table with an early career irrigation sales rep from Bundaberg and
lovely lady with a mind sharp as a knife who I later realised was <a

McGowan AO</a>.</p>

<h3>Side Event - AgTech Pitch</h3>
<p>Semi-unofficially the night continued on at the Rydges hotel with the
International AgTech Pitch, touted as a raucous event pitting
representatives of start-ups from around the world.</p>
<p>There were many great talks and I especially found interesting the
amount of start-up pitches focused on fermentation on-farm. These
technologies are looking to deliver fermentation tanks which can use
crop residues, like baggase and other crop stubble, to make chemical
molecules that are precursors to jet fuel and other industrial
practices. I like how this might fit into future farms, that are
potentially net energy producers, maybe with enough additional power to
have portable Haber-Bosch machines synthesising fertilisers from the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>The presentation that took away the top gongs was a pitch by <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-smith-woodside/">Rachel
Smith</a> from <a href="https://www.enclume.com.au/">Enclume</a>. Rachel
pitched a robotic remote sensing rig that can monitor crop phenology
experiments with a cable suspended camera. This invention circumvents <a
href="https://www.casa.gov.au/">CASA</a> restrictions which require
drone pilots to be monitoring or present when in control of miniature
aircraft.</p>

<h3>Sideline event - Extending Research Impact Breakfast</h3>
<p>In the morning of day two CSIRO’s <a

Australia’s Biosecurity (CAB)</a> mission hosted a breakfast at the
Ecosciences Precinct. I helped host this sideline event where we
highlighted the <a

CAB, and the co-design process for designing decision support tools for
primary producers. There was some excellent engagement with the
attendees and potentially new contacts made to collaborate with
co-design projects. If you would like to know more and find out if you
can be involved please <a href="mailto:paul.melloy@csiro.au">contact

<h4>The Future of food production</h4>
<p>Another connect &amp; collaborate session drew my eye early on the
second day, “The future of food: Innovate or fall behind”. This followed
a hypothetical of where do we see agriculture and horticulture in 25
years time? Not only were we thinking of the aspiring technologies that
will be available, but also the social and economic drivers that could
constrain the supply chains.</p>

<p>Our team thought back of how far we have come in the last 25 years,
as a indicator to the progress we could make in the next quarter
century. We came up with a disruptive industry taking advantage of
downsizing farming at scale that could happen with robotics, automation
and gig economies. Our idea “Air-farm” is a company that allows farming
corporate stakeholders to lease land and equipment to farm managers and
small businesses looking to deliver bespoke products with a story to end
consumers.</p>

<div id="intimate-connections-with-change-makers"
class="section level4">
<h4>Intimate connections with change makers</h4>
<p>I dropped into another connect and collaborate session to connect and
discuss some of the challenges facing the agricultural industry with
industry leaders. I sampled conversations where primary producers were
really struggling to meet the increasing compliance requirements placed
on them by Supermarkets and the wider industry. I also chatted with <a
href="https://agronomeye.com.au/about/">Simon Butler from Agronomeye</a>
about the role of remote sensing in leverageing benefits to natural
capital.</p>
</div>
<div id="d-ocean-farming" class="section level4">
<h4>3D ocean farming</h4>
<p>Bren Smith from <a href="https://www.greenwave.org/">GreenWave</a>
gave an entertaining talk about his experience with “Tech Bro’s” with
large financial interests moving too fast to deliver half baked green
promises to keen investors. Bren did not mince words and highlighted the
folly of moving too quickly on over hyped technology that attracts large
capital with insufficient validating hard data. His talk was a real
window into the anger of US working class people towards the big
business elites who trample all over them in pursuit of cash. His point
of view showed why the country elected a divisive leader promising to
disrupt the disrupter’s, and return the power to the working class. It
would also be remiss of me not to mention his farmer collective achieve
more with less, to deliver a carbon negative ocean farming system that
is profitable.</p>

<h4>Big bold questions</h4>
<p>Closing out the event was a session inviting a unrestrained
discussion on the key challenges which arose over the two day event. I
unfortunate did not get a list of the responses and could not summarise
them.</p>
<p>Cathy McGowan AO gave a great closing address, and urged everyone to
consider how they will make a difference in the next 12 months within
their circle of influence.</p>
