### Queensland AgTech Summit  

Kicking off the week was the [Queensland Governments *AgTech Summit*.](https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/news-media/campaigns/agtech/action/qld-agtech-summit)
While networking was a key highlight for everyone attending, one of the keynotes
by Jerome Leroy of [InFarm](https://www.infarm.io/), conveyed some insights for 
aspiring start-ups and researchers alike.
Not only should AgTech interventions be driven by solving a problem growers have
they need to provide **Value**.  

<center>

  $Value = \frac{Outcome \times Trust^{*}}{Effort \times Time \times Cost} \times Perceived Risk$  
  \*trust = Probability it works x Intent  
</center>
<br>  
  
To unpack this equation further; with out building trust in the delivery of an
'outcome' or (Agtech product) and the *intent* to follow-up on issues or servicing
the 'outcome' with support it has a **_low value_** to growers.
Additionally effort, time and cost to adopt, the lower the value of the technology
to growers. 
There are many ways you can cut this equation, however it comes down to fact growers
are wise to the parade of snake oil merchants and need to see there is _value_ 
in the *time*, *effort* and *cost* to adopt new tech.  

Another stand out example of poor relationship between researchers and growers 
was provided by Natalie Engel (If I recall correctly). 
After they were contacted by a researcher about hosting some research they sort
legal advice at the cost of $400. 
However the researcher never returned their call and they were left out of pocket
despite being interested in hosting the researchers.
