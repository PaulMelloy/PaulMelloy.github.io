This blog will likely be a work in progress, however if you are visiting my
home town of Brisbane and looking for a few things to do, here are some of my 
top picks.

<br>  

## Enoggera Lake (or 'reservoir')

The Enoggera reservoir has a lot to offer and perhaps is a bit of a hidden gem.
It has almost everything to offer:  
**Walk-about-Creek Discovery Center**  
  Arriving by car off Mt. Nebo Rd you will be first greated by the Walk-about 
  Creek Discovery centre which includes a cafe, wedding venue and zoo. 
  Randomly you can see kangaroos, Wombats, snakes, crocs and platapuses in the 
  Animal enclosure for a small entry fee.  
  
**Local history**  
  Originally constructed to supply water for a growing Brisbane population, there 
  are some interesting facts that go along with the dam, it was supposed to be
  one of five to be built up the D'Agular range, however after it was built the 
  following up stream dams never were built.  
  
**Swimming and Fishing**  
  Cool off in summer or brave the cold in winter, the *Lake* is open to recreation
  such as swimming, paddlecraft and fishing. 
  Access the swimming area from the Walk-about Creek Discovery Centre car park.
  You can also hire kayaks, and paddleboards on weekends in summer.  
  
**Hiking Trails**  
  There are many hiking trails that start and end here, from short 5km walks 
  around the north side of the lake, near the waters edge. 
  To multi-day hikes up into D'Agular National park.
  In fact you can follow trails all the way up to Mt. Nebo, Mt. Glorious, and 
  Beyond. 
  Some bikepackers adventure all the way up to Kilcoy and around Somerset Dam.  
  
**Mountain Biking**
  Fire trails around the lake also open to the MTBs and there is a pump track
  near the discovery centre to practice skills. 
  However the pump track is not maintained super well, so go at your own risk.
  There are some good begginer tracks for kids that are usually less overgrown 
  though.

### ~~~ Getting there ~~~  
  **Car**  
  You can drive to the Walkabout creek discovery Centre. 
  Parking might be competative in Summer.
  
  **Public Transport**  
  Check out [Translinks journey planner](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/journey-planner) 
  and set the destination to "Gap park and ride; Illowra Street, The Gap QLD". 
  When you hop off at the stop, walk west towards the car park and Dam wall. 
  There is a footpath that you can follow that will take you up to the swimming 
  area and trail heads.  
  
  **Uber/Taxi**  
  If I have to explain this, it is probably not the travel method for you ...

## North Stradbroke Island  

While technically not in Brisbane this has to be my No. 1 favorite place in the
world. The beaches are just amazing!!
> Must see: while there is the gorge walk at the point of Point lookout.  

### ~~~ Getting there ~~~  

  **Car**  
  Catch the car ferry from cleaveland to Dunwich and explore the island. 
  Just don't miss Point Lookout, where you will want to budget the most of your
  time on the island
  
  **Public Transport**  
  *Train -> Bus -> Boat -> Bus* to get to the beach  
  
  Check out [Translinks journey planner](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/journey-planner) 
  and set the destination to "Mooloomba Rd, Point Lookout QLD".
