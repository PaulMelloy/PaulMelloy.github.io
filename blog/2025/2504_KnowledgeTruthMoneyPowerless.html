class="section level1">
<h1>Knowledge, Truth, Money and Powerless – Universities (a
reponse)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>These view are my own and have no connection to my
employer.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an open reply to a mate, Olger Quicy, a guest writer for the
blog <a
href="https://www.fresheconomicthinking.com/p/devaluating-everything-universities">“Devaluating
Everything. Universities”</a>.</p>
<p>I have to disagree with the views of my beguiling friend Mr Quincy,
that “technology, feminisation, and immigration” are the decay of
universities. However, while I have to agree that universities in
Australia are not the prestigious institutions they once were. It is
easy to compare the triumphs of the past to the disappointments of today
and superimpose our prejudices. I identify the views of Mr Quincy as
being narrow, in mind and scope.</p>
<p>It is indeed a frustrating scene the rot that has established in
universities and it is not the fault of progressive ideals. In my view,
it is indeed the opposite, and where I superimpose my prejudices with my
disappointment on the university degree-mills today, a successful
conservative agenda to control the narrative.</p>
<p>Technology is developing at an astounding rate, and does indeed have
universities on the back foot. Large language models (LLMs), or less
accurately artificial intelligence (AI) have indeed changed the game,
just as the advert of the internet prior to plagiarism checkers. As our
friend has let us sail into the past to examples where technology has
caused upheaval in our ability to judge, have students done the work to
deserve the degree. Spell checkers were once seen as cheating,
typewriters could obfuscate the true authors of written assessment. The
advent of the printing press provides an analogous to the Internet of
today. With the ease of access to books, for commoners to write and
disseminate knowledge without the oversight from experts in the church
or monasteries who will value the knowledge of university experts. LLMs
are the most recent procession of technological tools we navigate in the
treacherous waters of learning and gaining knowledge.</p>
<p>At this stage I wish to encourage the readers to step back and take a
wider view, metaphorically and literally. Right now you do not read this
in a magazine, or newspaper, book or bulletin board. I don’t stand
before you on my soap box, you likely read this on your digital devices
which some in the past say have cheapened access to knowledge. Do you
have notifications screaming at you the latest incredulous announcement
by President Trump and interfering with your focus read this piece. Are
there pictures adorning the words which might have once been viewed as
immature adornments to rigorous literature. Do you have a fact-checker
plug-in prompting for second opinions.</p>
<p>Taking a wider view, will universities die due to technology? Or do
they serve as a necessary hand on the tiller to navigate seas in a
maelstrom of competing information. By now I hope you see the lighthouse
through the squalls and recognise that these beacons of light ‘should
be’ our universities. Institutions that provide guidance in a
‘post-truth’ world.</p>
<p>Right now I chart course to the provocation that <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminization_(sociology)">feminisation</a>
is associated with loss in value. I feel this point has no solid
argument, I could cry <a
href="https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">‘correlation
does not equate to causation’</a>, however the statistician in me
objects and points out a covariate can <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698915002497">mask</a>
the causal inference. I apologise for no nautical themed metaphor here,
but the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">‘DAG’</a> I
am gives you this this pun. Suffice to say, feminisation is profitable.
As alluded to by Mr Quincy, other factors were at play during
feminisation, and the patriarchy recognises women provide cheaper
labour, it is simple economics.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/education/education-and-work-australia/latest-release#engagement-in-work-and-or-study">The
statistics show a higher proportion of men in full employment or
study</a>, especially engineering. However of these, a higher proportion
of females studying and not in the workforce. The reality of Australia’s
current economy is that there are greater incentives for men to obtain
free TAFE diplomas or apprenticeships towards high paying occupations in
the construction sector than higher degrees through University. I
regularly lament a sliding doors moment at age 18 while staking shelves
at a supermarket, a customer offered me an apprenticeship as a builder.
Had I taken it I would today be much better financially secure than my
current career in academia and science. It is my view the devaluing of
higher degrees came before the feminisation and we see today a shift in
how the patriarchy is maintained.</p>
<p>This leads me to Olgers final bug-bear, immigration. At this stage I
feel the fatigue and will reward the reader with being as succinct as
possible. From the turn of the century (2000), the change in University
to the businesses models probably likely in 2008, (shortly after Olger
completed his first university degree) <a
href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2022L00845/latest/text">when the
federal government introduced the 485 Graduate Visas</a>. This
legislation permitted international graduates to extend their stay if
they found work I high demand occupations. I have met and worked with
many immigrants who took advantage of this legislation to gain
citizenship in Australia. In 2018 one former workmate from Singapore
conveyed their surprise the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murugappan_family_asylum_claims">Murugappan
‘Biloela’ family</a> did not make use of this avenue for Australian
citizenship and said they must have been poorly informed. Subsequent <a
href="https://universitiesaustralia.edu.au/policy-submissions/teaching-learning-funding/how-universities-are-funded/">2017
caps to the Commonwealth Grant Scheme (CGS)</a> have led universities to
focus less on domestic students and pivot to seek revenue from
international students to maintain their employment of their staff.</p>
<p>Today Universities are not what they were 20 years ago, and we should
not be surprised by this fact. Universities have had to be agile to
adapt to changes in government legislation that has effectively weaken
their power in the Australian community. I view the <a
href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-04/international-education-year-of-uncertainty-foreign-students/104765238">changes
to international student numbers</a> by the blue and red tie wearing
politicians as mechanisms to further remove funding in order to reduce
their power and capacity to counter conservative agendas which are
regularly criticised by university academics. They are merely using the
guise of the housing crisis to push this agenda.</p>
<p>Finally it is my view education needs <a
href="https://theconversation.com/we-need-to-change-the-way-universities-assess-students-starting-with-these-3-things-203048">reform
internationally to sustain the essential role of Universities into the
future.</a> Simply passing the required university subjects should not
equate to having the knowledge to be awarded a degree. Education needs
to be undertaken so students graduate knowing what they know, but
crucially knowing what they don’t know. To achieve this we need to
incentivise course students and coordinators to review assessments
together, rather than receive a reductive score.</p>
